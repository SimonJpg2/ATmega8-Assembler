<h1 align="center">ATmega8-Assembler</h1>

## This repository is a collection of assembler programs I developed in the LGS

For my A-Levels I developed programs written in Assembly. It is possible to develope programs in C/C++ for the ATmega8 but we focused on Assembly.

You need a Mini-USB cable to connect to the board.

The Hardware I used and references for more detailed information are linked below.
